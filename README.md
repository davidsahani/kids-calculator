### Release Builds

When it comes to the release builds, here's what you need to know:

- Android:
  - For new arm-based Android devices, we recommend downloading the version ending with `*arm64-v8a.apk.`
  - If the above version is not compatible with your device (indicating a non-arm64 architecture), please use the version ending with `*armeabi-v7a.apk.`
  - Note: If you have a device with a different architecture, building the project yourself is required, as it is not officially supported for testing reasons.

- Windows:
  - For Windows, simply download the zip file ending with `*windows.zip.`


### Known Issues:

**Black Screen Issue**

- Description: The text widget in the app displays a black screen when performing division with certain values on specific Android devices.
- Cause: This issue is a limitation of the kivymd framework's text widget, as it cannot handle the excessive amount of text generated during division.
- Fixability: Unfortunately, this issue cannot be fixed, as it stems from a limitation within the kivymd framework itself.
- Potential Solution: One possible approach is to limit the division calculations to a level where the black screen issue does not occur on the affected device. However, this solution may introduce limitations for other devices and does not guarantee that the issue won't arise on different devices.
